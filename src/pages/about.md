I'm Cassidy, and I like to make memes and dreams and software!

If you want to see more from me outside of this _space_, [my website](https://cassidoo.co) has a bunch of links to follow! You should also check out my [newsletter](https://cassidoo.co/newsletter), or my word game [Jumblie](https://jumblie.com/?utm_campaign=blahg&utm_source=github), or my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/cassidoo). Or don't. Follow your dreams.

Anyway, welcome to my blog AKA digital garden AKA mind dump land!
