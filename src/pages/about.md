I'm Cassidy, and I like to make memes and dreams and software.

When I’m not working, I like to watch movies, play music, eat a lot, practice Spanish, and play games. I like brainstorming projects that I build maybe half the time. It's nice to dream.

You should check out my website, [cassidoo.co](https://cassidoo.co), my [newsletter](https://cassidoo.co/newsletter), or my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/cassidoo). Or don’t. I’m not your mother.

Anyway, welcome to my blog AKA digital garden AKA mind dump land!
